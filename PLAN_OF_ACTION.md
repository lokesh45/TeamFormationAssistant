1. Create an interface to run "TeamAssigner.py" after entering new member and project details. Currently, this needs to be done explicitly from the terminal.
2. Currently, "TeamAssigner.py" executes for all the members (new and old). Realistic scenario will be to run the algorithm for new members only. Therefore, update "TeamAssigner.py" for the same.
3. Provide State Management to ensure that the URLs will be accessed only after a particular action is executed. As for an example "/success" should be accessible only after form submit has been performed and not otherwise.
4. Use ORM instead of raw SQL queries for the backend.
5. Wrap the code and create a package so that the entire application can be downloaded from some standard package manager (eg. pip).
6. Dockerise the application.
7. Hosting the website on to AWS.
8. Improve error handling to display relevant error messages instead of generic error messages on the front end.
9. Include test cases for frontend and backend testing as well as end-to-end testing.
10. Call the test suite from .travis.yml. 
11. Create end-to-end flow by integrating separate code chunks of NodeJs, JavaScript and Flask.
